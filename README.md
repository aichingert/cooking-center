# Notes
I wanted to create a website to use for me to take notes in school


## Setup
If you want to start the website you need to install 

`cargo install trunk`, `cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli` and `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

after you installed these three, you can start it with `trunk serve`
