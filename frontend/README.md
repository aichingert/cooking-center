# Notes frontend
Here is the design and structure of the website. This is my first time using rust to build a website.

## Setup
If you have installed everything that is mentioned on the main README.md you can just run the website with `trunk serve`

## Contribute
If you find something that you think would be better in another way, then feel free to make an issue or pull request
